# linear

stack, queue, deque, linked list, double linked list

insert,/delete, search, max/min, successor/predecessor

## HEAP

binary tree
n.parent = n//2
n.left = 2n
n.right = 2n+1

height = lg n

### max/min heap
max heap: parent>n>children

### Priority Queue (heap powered)

given arr

```python
def showmax(arr):
	return arr[0]

```

## current issues
* no examplary implementation, most are arbitary code snippets
* confusion between functional programming and object-oriented programming
*** use provided list/dict and user-defined funcs
*** design new class objects with funcs included
* reuse of code from .py to .md

## hashing comparsion:
direct vs. chaining vs. open address
